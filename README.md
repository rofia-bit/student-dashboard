> A **gamified student dashboard** that turns productivity into a game 

---

##  Overview
**Nerd-Out** is a work-in-progress dashboard that transforms studying into a rewarding experience.  
You don’t just complete tasks; you **gain EXP**, **level up**, and **evolve your character** as you grow academically.  

Because learning shouldn’t feel like a chore; it should feel like a *game*.

---

##  Features
- **Task Management** – Add, edit, and complete study goals or assignments.  
-  **EXP & Level System** – Earn experience for completing tasks and see your progress.  
-  **Evolving Character** – Your avatar grows stronger as you advance.  
-  **Achievements & Badges** – Unlock rewards for consistency and milestones.  
- **Progress Dashboard** – Visual charts and streaks that keep you motivated.

##  Motivation
Most dashboards are **functional but boring**. Nerd-Out brings excitement and dopamine into your workflow.  
Each completed task is **an achievement**, every productive day a **level up**.  

> “If learning feels like a grind — make it a game.”
